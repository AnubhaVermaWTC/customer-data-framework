Before you can use the OAuth-Server you have to define some options in the [Configuration Tree](./03_Configuration.md). 

# Working with OAuth

This chapter describes of how to use the OAuth - Server. To help you build a authentication/authorization-system 
as quickly as possible to handle a client coming from different types of devices or platforms (Web- or mobile App).

There are several ways to authenticate and authorize an user. 
For authentication/authorization-issues you can use grants to identify a certain user. 
Before those grants are described in detail, 
there are some terms that need to be described first:

- User 

  In this documentation an User is considered as registered Person on your platform that you want to establish a authentication/authorization-system for.  

- Client

  In this documentation a Client is considered to be an application that can be executed on different devices like a application on a PC or on a Smartphone.
  Therefore a Client represents only the mean of how an User can be authenticated with, not an User itself.
  
  The service `CustomerProviderInterface` is used to get an instance of an User that you want to authenticate by using the OAuth - Server. 
  For Details see [Working with Customers](./05_Working-with-Customers.md) 
  
- Access - Token

  After an User has been authenticated successfully, they receive an Access-Token from the OAuth-Server so that they are allowed to access certain API's, services or other resources of your platform.
  An Access-Token is a JWT value that contains some auth-information like `expires_in`, `access_token` and `refresh_token`. 
  This information is encrypted and is decrypted with the OAuth-Server. With help of a valid `access_token` an User is found.
  
  What you want to do with a found User or what resources you want to protected by Access-Tokens, it's up to you. You can use your own logic here. 
  
  There is a Starter-Service called `UserInfo` though, when you want to request information about an User like 
  Forename, Surname or Email-Address. 
  This service can be configured with `pimcore_customer_management_framework.oauth_server.userExporter` to define what attributes should be read out of an User.
  
  You can use this service by calling `/cmf_oauth/userinfo` to get concrete information about an user. 
  As an example, such a request could be done with a `\GuzzleHttp\Client`:
    
  ```php
  $httpClient = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
    $accessTokenJwt = "a_former_access_token_jwt";
    $res = $httpClient->request(
        'GET',
        'https://mywebsite/cmf_oauth/userinfo',
        [
            'headers' => [
                'Authorization' => $accessTokenJwt
            ]
        ]
  );
  ```

- Auth - Code
 
  In exchange for an Access-Token an Auth-Code is needed. 
  An Auth-Code is also a JWT value that contains some auth-information like `expire_time`, `auth_code_id`, `redirect_uri` and `client_id`. 

  Auth-Code is sent back to an user after they have been authenticated successfully. So the authentication process is over, but
  they have to get an Access-Token as well. That's why a requesting application has to remember the got Auth-Code and 
  has to sent it to the OAuth-Server in exchange for an Access-Token.


# Grants:

Depending what type of application respectively Client you want to establish a authentication/authorization-system for, 
you can either use an Auth-, an Implicit or a Password-Grant.

# Auth - Code Grant 

  When you want to establish a authentication/authorization-system for a third party (not trusted) application then you should use an Auth-Code-Grant.
  As first step you need to make a request to the controller action `formAuthorizeAuthGrantClient`:
  
  ```php
  /**
   * REQUEST A NEW AUTH-CODE BY LOGGING IN
   * @param Request $request
   * @Route("/form_auth_code", name="form_auth_code_path")
   * @return RedirectResponse
   * @throws \Exception
   */
  public function formAuthorizeAuthGrantClient(Request $request)
  {
     ....
  }
  ```  
  
  This action expects some GET-Parameter:
  
  -  client_id (must)
     
     It's a name like `"myawesomeauthgrant"`
     
  -  redirect_uri (must)
  
     A URI that you want a client to be redirected, like `http://www.google.com`
     
  -  response_type (must)
  
     This must have got the value of `"code"`
  
  -  state (optional)
  
     Can be any value and stored in a user's session. 
     
  This action renders a symfony-form that an User can be authenticated by. After done successfully, they are 
  redirected to where the former defined `redirect_uri` parameter points to. 
  
  An Auth-Code (`code`) and (if passed) `state` parameter is appended to the redirected uri as well:
  
  `http://www.google.com?code=access_code_jwt&state=some_state_value`
  
  The `code` parameter can then be used to request an Access-Token. For this to work, a request must be made to `accessToken`:
  
  ```php
  /**
   * REQUEST AN ACCESS-TOKEN BY USING AN AUTH-CODE
   * @param Request $request
   * @Route("/access_token", name="access_token_path")
   * @return JsonResponse
   * @throws \Exception
   */
  public function accessToken(Request $request)
  {
     ....
  }
  ```
    
  This action expects some POST-Parameter:
      
  - code (must)
             
      It's the got JWT requested with `formAuthorizeAuthGrantClient`
         
  - client_id (must)
         
      It's a name like `"myawesomeauthgrant"`
         
  - client_secret (must)
          
      It's a value that must be kept secret 
                  
  - redirect_uri (must)
      
      It's the same URI again
         
  - grant_type (must)
          
      This must have got the value of `"authorization_code"` 
    
  If the passed Auth-Code (`code`) is valid, then a JSON is returned. This JSON contains:
    
  - token_type
    
       A static value `"Bearer"`
    
  - expires_in
    
       A timestamp in seconds states when this Access-Token expired by
         
  - access_token
    
       A JWT value that an application can use to request protected resources.
         
  - refresh_token
        
       A JWT value that an application can use to refresh an expired Access-Token.
     
    
  At this point an application is authorized to request sensitive information or protected resources stored on your platform. 
    
  An Access-Token can expire though, so that an application needs to get a new one to access protected resources. 
  There is the action called `refreshToken` to exchange a Refresh-Token for an new Access-Token:
  
  ```php
  /**
   * REQUEST A NEW ACCESS-TOKEN BY USING A REFRESH-TOKEN
   * @param Request $request
   * @Route("/refresh_token", name="refresh_token_path")
   * @return JSONResponse
   * @throws \Exception
   */
  public function refreshToken(Request $request)
  {
     ....
  }
  ```
   
  This action expects some POST-Parameter:
        
  - refresh_token (must)
               
      A former got Refresh-Token as JWT from the action `accessToken`
           
  - client_id (must)
           
      It's a name like `"myawesomeauthgrant"`
           
  - client_secret (must)
            
      It's a value that must be kept secret 
          
  - grant_type (must)
            
      This must have got the value of `"refresh_token"` 
  
  If the got Refresh-Token (`refresh_token`) is valid, then a similar structured JSON is returned as with `accessToken`.


# Implicit Grant


  When you want to establish a authentication/authorization-system for a third party (not trusted) application then you could use an Implicit-Grant.
  As first step you need to make a request to the controller action `formAuthorizeImplicitGrantClient`:
  
  ```php
  /**
   * REQUEST A NEW ACCESS-TOKEN BY USING AN IMPLICIT GRANT
   * @param Request $request
   * @Route("/form_auth_implicit", name="form_auth_implicit_path")
   * @return RedirectResponse|Response
   * @throws \Exception
   */
  public function formAuthorizeImplicitGrantClient(Request $request)
  {
     ....
  }
  ```  
  This action expects some POST-Parameter:
    
  - client_id (must)
       
       It's a name like `"myawesomeimplicitgrant"`
       
  - redirect_uri (must)
    
       A URI that you want a client to be redirected, like `http://www.google.com`
       
  - response_type (must)
    
       This must have got the value of `"token"` 
    
  - state (optional)
    
       Can be any value and stored in a user's session. 
  
  If the got Auth-Code (`code`) is valid, then a JSON is returned. This JSON contains:
      
  - token_type
      
       A static value `"Bearer"`
      
  - expires_in
      
       A timestamp in seconds states when this Access-Token expired by
           
  - access_token
      
       A JWT value that an application can use to request protected resources.
           
  - state
          
       It's the same value that sent in the original request. You should compare this value with the value stored in the userâ€™s session to ensure the authorization code obtained is in response to requests made by this client rather than another client application.  


# Password Grant

  When you want to establish a authentication/authorization-system for a first party (trusted or your own) application then you could use an Password-Grant.
  As first step you need to make a request to the controller action `authorizePasswordGrantClient`:
  
  ```php
  /**
   * REQUEST A NEW ACCESS-TOKEN BY USING AN IMPLICIT GRANT
   * @param Request $request
   * @Route("/form_auth_password", name="form_auth_password_path")
   * @return RedirectResponse|Response|JSONResponse
   * @throws \Exception
   */
  public function authorizePasswordGrantClient(Request $request)
  {
     ....
  }
  ```  
  This action expects some POST-Parameter:
    
  - client_id (must)
       
       It's a name like `"myawesomepasswordgrant"`
       
  - client_secret (must)
              
       It's a value that must be kept secret 
        
  - grant_type (must)
    
       This must have got the value of `"password"` 
    
  - username (must)
    
       It's the username of a authenticating user
       
  - password (must)
      
       It's the password of a authenticating user
      
      
  If the got Authentication succeeded, then a JSON is returned. This JSON contains:
      
  - token_type
      
       A static value `"Bearer"`
      
  - expires_in
      
       A timestamp in seconds states when this Access-Token expired by
           
  - access_token
      
       A JWT value that an application can use to request protected resources.
           
  - refresh_token
          
       A JWT value that an application can use to refresh an expired Access-Token.
